abstract = {Geomagnetic storms start with activity on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR) driven. The ICME-driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC) driven or sheath (SH) driven by the geoeffective structure responsible for the peak of the storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near-Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH-driven event behaves more like a CIR-driven event than a MC-driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin â‰¤ -100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996-2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland-Stern or self-consistent electric field and either event-based Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provide the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self-consistent electric field better reproduces SH- and MC-driven events throughout most of the storm timeline, but the Volland-Stern electric field better reproduces CIR-driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data shows that SH-driven events behave more like MC-driven events than CIR-driven storms.},

abstract = {The Dynamic Global Core Plasma Model (DGCPM) is an empirical dynamical model of the plasmasphere which, despite its simple mathematical form, or perhaps because of its simple mathematical form, has enjoyed wide use in the space physics modeling community. In this paper we present some recent observations from the European quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array (EMMA) and compare these with the DGCPM. The observations suggest more rapid daytime refilling and loss than what is described in the DGCPM. We then modify the DGCPM by changing the values of some of its parameters, leaving the functional form intact. The modified DGCPM agrees much better with the EMMA observations. The modification resulted in an order-of-magnitude faster daytime refilling and nighttime loss. These results are also consistent with previous observations of daytime refilling.},

@article{Borovsky1997,
abstract = {A few times per month, the density of the plasma sheet is several times higher than its usual density. Such superdense plasma sheet intervals are observed both in the midtail region and at geosynchronous orbit. Typically at geosynchronous orbit, a superdense plasma sheet occurs on the first day of a geomagnetic storm and lasts about 12-18 hours. The occurrences of superdense plasma sheets are found to be related to a distinct pattern of Kp: Kp rising after it has been low for an extended period. The occurrences are also associated with high-density solar wind. Three sources for the material of the superdense plasma sheet are explored: (1) the outer plasmasphere, which is stripped away and drawn into the dayside neutral line when Kp increases, wherein it joins the lobe and eventually joins the plasma sheet; (2) high-density solar-wind, which may have its entry into the plasma sheet controlled by the solar-wind magnetic field; and (3) ionospheric outflow, which is known to be Kp dependent. The occurrence of a superdense plasma sheet has several consequences: it adds to the intensity of the ring current, it may alter the dynamics of the magnetotail and the nature of substorms, and it may provide an enhanced source population for storm-time energetic particles.

abstract = {The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) provides a high-performance flexible framework for physics-based space weather simulations, as well as for various space physics applications. The SWMF integrates numerical models of the Solar Corona, Eruptive Event Generator, Inner Heliosphere, Solar Energetic Particles, Global Magnetosphere, Inner Magnetosphere, Radiation Belt, Ionosphere Electrodynamics, and Upper Atmosphere into a high-performance coupled model. The components can be represented with alternative physics models, and any physically meaningful subset of the components can be used. The components are coupled to the control module via standardized interfaces, and an efficient parallel coupling toolkit is used for the pairwise coupling of the components. The execution and parallel layout of the components is controlled by the SWMF. Both sequential and concurrent execution models are supported. The SWMF enables simulations that were not possible with the individual physics models. Using reasonably high spatial and temporal resolutions in all of the coupled components, the SWMF runs significantly faster than real time on massively parallel supercomputers. This paper presents the design and implementation of the SWMF and some demonstrative tests. Future papers will describe validation (comparison of model results with measurements) and applications to challenging space weather events. The SWMF is publicly available to the scientific community for doing geophysical research. We also intend to expand the SWMF in collaboration with other model developers.

@article{Gallagher2000,
abstract = {Over 40 years of ground and spacecraft plasmaspheric measurements have resulted in many statistical descriptions of plasmaspheric properties. In some cases, these properties have been represented as analytical descriptions that are valid for specific regions or conditions. For the most part, what has not been done is to extend regional empirical descriptions or models to the plasmasphere as a whole. In contrast, many related investigations depend on the use of representative plasmaspheric conditions throughout the inner magnetosphere. Wave propagation, involving the transport of energy through the magnetosphere, is strongly affected by thermal plasma density and its composition. Ring current collisional and wave particle losses also strongly depend on these quantities. Plasmaspheric also plays a secondary role in influencing radio signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) is an attempt to assimilate previous empirical evidence and regional models for plasmaspheric density into a continuous, smooth model of thermal plasma density in the inner magnetosphere. In that spirit, the International Reference Ionosphere is currently used to complete the low altitude description of density and composition in the model. The models and measurements on which the GCPM is currently based and its relationship to IRI will be discussed.},

@article{Ober1997,
abstract = {A dynamic global core plasma model (DGCPM) is used to investigate the effects of subauroral ion drift (SAID) events on the formation of trough density profiles in the outer plasmasphere during periods of high magnetic activity. The DGCPM includes the influences of convection on the changing flux tube volumes, as well as daytime refilling and nighttime draining of plasma, to calculate the plasma tube contents and equatorial plasma density distribution versus time throughout the magnetosphere. SAIDs are regions of latitudinally narrow westward flow of plasma equatorward of the auroral zone. We present DGCPM results for various presumed SAID locations and durations relative to enhanced substorm convection onset and decay, to parametrically elicit the formation of plasmaspheric density trough structures resulting from SAID effects. It is found that imposing a SAID event in the dusk-evening sector for 30 min leads to the formation of a narrow (less than 1 RE near the equatorial plane) embedded plasma density trough in the dusk bulge region. The modeled plasmasphere density profiles with troughs generally resemble plasmasphere density profiles observed from DE 1 measurements. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Recent observations from various instruments onboard IMAGE and CLUSTER spacecrafts have made significant advances in our understanding of plasma density irregularities, plume formation, erosion and refilling of the plasmasphere, presence of thermal structures in the plasmasphere and existence of radiation belts. Still modeling work and more observational data are required for clear understanding of plasmapause formation, existence of various sizes and shapes of density structures inside the plasmasphere as well as on the surface of the plasmapause, plasmasphere filling and erosion processes; which are important in understanding the relation of the process proceeding in the Sun and solar wind to the processes observed in the Earths atmosphere and ionosphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Welling2014,
abstract = {Numerous studies of the terrestrial magnetosphere that use global magnetohydrodynamic codes have found that the model's inner boundary can act as a significant source of plasma, even if the radial velocity about the boundary is held at zero. Though inherent in many models, this "de facto outflow" is poorly understood. This work uses the Block Adaptive Tree Solar Wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme MHD model to investigate the behavior of this type of outflow as a function of boundary conditions and solar wind drivers. It is found that even for temporally and spatially constant boundary conditions, the mass is accelerated away from the body in a dynamic manner. Fluxes organize into cusp, polar cap, and auroral zone concentrations. Pressure gradient forces appear predominantly responsible for cusp and polar cap outflow, while the Lorentz force, resulting from field-aligned current systems, is the strongest driver of outflow in other regions. Integrated fluxes probed just outside of the inner boundary vary linearly as a function of cross polar cap potential and solar wind dynamic pressure. The resulting dynamics strongly resemble patterns found in in situ measurements, while net fluences agree within an order of magnitude. Two free parameters, inner boundary mass density and composition, can strongly affect results. Accounting for these unknowns is likely best left to physics-based or empirical specifications of outflow. Despite this, such outflow appears to be an acceptable proxy. Key Points MHD inner boundary conditions can act as a passive source of ionospheric plasma MHD forces dynamically accelerate this density into the greater domain Total fluences correspond to observed values in magnitude and dynamics {\textcopyright}2014.

abstract = {Geomagnetic storms start with activity on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR) driven. The ICME-driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC) driven or sheath (SH) driven by the geoeffective structure responsible for the peak of the storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near-Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH-driven event behaves more like a CIR-driven event than a MC-driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin â‰¤ -100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996-2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland-Stern or self-consistent electric field and either event-based Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provide the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self-consistent electric field better reproduces SH- and MC-driven events throughout most of the storm timeline, but the Volland-Stern electric field better reproduces CIR-driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data shows that SH-driven events behave more like MC-driven events than CIR-driven storms.},
