abstract = {A variety of magnetospheric plasma populations have been proposed to impact solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. These magnetospheric populations could mass load the dayside magnetopause and include the plasmaspheric plume, plasma cloak, ion plasma sheet, and dayside ion outflow. Each has different densities, ion composition, and spatial/temporal occurrences at the dayside magnetopause which may coupling in different ways. These properties are reviewed as well as proposed mechanisms for impacting wave formation and magnetic reconnection. Broader discussion on control of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling governed by through local boundary physics or through the driving of the solar wind (local versus global control) is also considered.},

abstract = {The Dynamic Global Core Plasma Model (DGCPM) is an empirical dynamical model of the plasmasphere which, despite its simple mathematical form, or perhaps because of its simple mathematical form, has enjoyed wide use in the space physics modeling community. In this paper we present some recent observations from the European quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array (EMMA) and compare these with the DGCPM. The observations suggest more rapid daytime refilling and loss than what is described in the DGCPM. We then modify the DGCPM by changing the values of some of its parameters, leaving the functional form intact. The modified DGCPM agrees much better with the EMMA observations. The modification resulted in an order-of-magnitude faster daytime refilling and nighttime loss. These results are also consistent with previous observations of daytime refilling.},

abstract = {A dynamic global core plasma model (DGCPM) is used to investigate the effects of subauroral ion drift (SAID) events on the formation of trough density profiles in the outer plasmasphere during periods of high magnetic activity. The DGCPM includes the influences of convection on the changing flux tube volumes, as well as daytime refilling and nighttime draining of plasma, to calculate the plasma tube contents and equatorial plasma density distribution versus time throughout the magnetosphere. SAIDs are regions of latitudinally narrow westward flow of plasma equatorward of the auroral zone. We present DGCPM results for various presumed SAID locations and durations relative to enhanced substorm convection onset and decay, to parametrically elicit the formation of plasmaspheric density trough structures resulting from SAID effects. It is found that imposing a SAID event in the dusk-evening sector for 30 min leads to the formation of a narrow (less than 1 RE near the equatorial plane) embedded plasma density trough in the dusk bulge region. The modeled plasmasphere density profiles with troughs generally resemble plasmasphere density profiles observed from DE 1 measurements. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {A few times per month, the density of the plasma sheet is several times higher than its usual density. Such superdense plasma sheet intervals are observed both in the midtail region and at geosynchronous orbit. Typically at geosynchronous orbit, a superdense plasma sheet occurs on the first day of a geomagnetic storm and lasts about 12-18 hours. The occurrences of superdense plasma sheets are found to be related to a distinct pattern of Kp: Kp rising after it has been low for an extended period. The occurrences are also associated with high-density solar wind. Three sources for the material of the superdense plasma sheet are explored: (1) the outer plasmasphere, which is stripped away and drawn into the dayside neutral line when Kp increases, wherein it joins the lobe and eventually joins the plasma sheet; (2) high-density solar-wind, which may have its entry into the plasma sheet controlled by the solar-wind magnetic field; and (3) ionospheric outflow, which is known to be Kp dependent. The occurrence of a superdense plasma sheet has several consequences: it adds to the intensity of the ring current, it may alter the dynamics of the magnetotail and the nature of substorms, and it may provide an enhanced source population for storm-time energetic particles.

abstract = {Geomagnetic storms start with activity on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR) driven. The ICME-driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC) driven or sheath (SH) driven by the geoeffective structure responsible for the peak of the storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near-Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH-driven event behaves more like a CIR-driven event than a MC-driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin ≤ -100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996-2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland-Stern or self-consistent electric field and either event-based Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provide the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self-consistent electric field better reproduces SH- and MC-driven events throughout most of the storm timeline, but the Volland-Stern electric field better reproduces CIR-driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data shows that SH-driven events behave more like MC-driven events than CIR-driven storms.},

abstract = {The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) provides a high-performance flexible framework for physics-based space weather simulations, as well as for various space physics applications. The SWMF integrates numerical models of the Solar Corona, Eruptive Event Generator, Inner Heliosphere, Solar Energetic Particles, Global Magnetosphere, Inner Magnetosphere, Radiation Belt, Ionosphere Electrodynamics, and Upper Atmosphere into a high-performance coupled model. The components can be represented with alternative physics models, and any physically meaningful subset of the components can be used. The components are coupled to the control module via standardized interfaces, and an efficient parallel coupling toolkit is used for the pairwise coupling of the components. The execution and parallel layout of the components is controlled by the SWMF. Both sequential and concurrent execution models are supported. The SWMF enables simulations that were not possible with the individual physics models. Using reasonably high spatial and temporal resolutions in all of the coupled components, the SWMF runs significantly faster than real time on massively parallel supercomputers. This paper presents the design and implementation of the SWMF and some demonstrative tests. Future papers will describe validation (comparison of model results with measurements) and applications to challenging space weather events. The SWMF is publicly available to the scientific community for doing geophysical research. We also intend to expand the SWMF in collaboration with other model developers.

abstract = {Over 40 years of ground and spacecraft plasmaspheric measurements have resulted in many statistical descriptions of plasmaspheric properties. In some cases, these properties have been represented as analytical descriptions that are valid for specific regions or conditions. For the most part, what has not been done is to extend regional empirical descriptions or models to the plasmasphere as a whole. In contrast, many related investigations depend on the use of representative plasmaspheric conditions throughout the inner magnetosphere. Wave propagation, involving the transport of energy through the magnetosphere, is strongly affected by thermal plasma density and its composition. Ring current collisional and wave particle losses also strongly depend on these quantities. Plasmaspheric also plays a secondary role in influencing radio signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) is an attempt to assimilate previous empirical evidence and regional models for plasmaspheric density into a continuous, smooth model of thermal plasma density in the inner magnetosphere. In that spirit, the International Reference Ionosphere is currently used to complete the low altitude description of density and composition in the model. The models and measurements on which the GCPM is currently based and its relationship to IRI will be discussed.},

abstract = {Numerous studies of the terrestrial magnetosphere that use global magnetohydrodynamic codes have found that the model's inner boundary can act as a significant source of plasma, even if the radial velocity about the boundary is held at zero. Though inherent in many models, this "de facto outflow" is poorly understood. This work uses the Block Adaptive Tree Solar Wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme MHD model to investigate the behavior of this type of outflow as a function of boundary conditions and solar wind drivers. It is found that even for temporally and spatially constant boundary conditions, the mass is accelerated away from the body in a dynamic manner. Fluxes organize into cusp, polar cap, and auroral zone concentrations. Pressure gradient forces appear predominantly responsible for cusp and polar cap outflow, while the Lorentz force, resulting from field-aligned current systems, is the strongest driver of outflow in other regions. Integrated fluxes probed just outside of the inner boundary vary linearly as a function of cross polar cap potential and solar wind dynamic pressure. The resulting dynamics strongly resemble patterns found in in situ measurements, while net fluences agree within an order of magnitude. Two free parameters, inner boundary mass density and composition, can strongly affect results. Accounting for these unknowns is likely best left to physics-based or empirical specifications of outflow. Despite this, such outflow appears to be an acceptable proxy.

In order to capture realistically the erosion of the nightside plasmapause and the formation of the drainage plume in a model of the plasmasphere, the electric field must be accurate. This study investigates how well five different electric field models drive the Dynamic Global Core Plasma Model during eight storm periods. The five electric field models are the Volland-Stern analytic formula with Maynard-Chen Kpdependence, two versions of the Weimer statistical models (96 and 05), and two versions of the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) technique using magnetometer and DMSP satellite data. Manually extracted plasmapause locations from images taken by the EUV instrument on the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite, as described by Goldstein et al. (2005), were compared to the simulation results throughout the main phase of the eight events. Three methods of calculating the plasmapause were employed to determine the best fit to EUV data, using the maximum gradient, a constant density contour (fit method), and the location in which the modeled density fell significantly below the specified saturation density for the given radial position (saturation method). It was found that the simulations driven by the Weimer (1996) model produced the best fit overall and that the fit and saturation methods worked best for matching the model results to the observations. {\textcopyright}2014.

Erosion causes the plasmasphere outer boundary, the plasmapause, to move inward on the nightside and outward on the dayside to form plumes of dense plasma extending sunward into the outer magnetosphere. Coupling between the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere can significantly modify the convection field, either enhancing sunward flows near dusk or shielding them on the night side.

abstract = {It is now well established that the ionosphere, because it acts as a significant source of plasma, plays a critical role in ring current dynamics. However, because the ring current deposits energy into the ionosphere, the inverse may also be true: the ring current can play a critical role in the dynamics of ionospheric outflow. This study uses a set of coupled, first-principles-based numerical models to test the dependence of ionospheric outflow on ring current-driven region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs). A moderate magnetospheric storm event is modeled with the Space Weather Modeling Framework using a global MHD code (Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme, BATS-R-US), a polar wind model (Polar Wind Outflow Model), and a bounce-averaged kinetic ring current model (ring current atmosphere interaction model with self-consistent magnetic field, RAM-SCB). Initially, each code is two-way coupled to all others except for RAM-SCB, which receives inputs from the other models but is not allowed to feed back pressure into the MHD model. The simulation is repeated with pressure coupling activated, which drives strong pressure gradients and region 2 FACs in BATS-R-US. It is found that the region 2 FACs increase heavy ion outflow by up to 6 times over the noncoupled results. The additional outflow further energizes the ring current, establishing an ionosphere-magnetosphere mass feedback loop. This study further demonstrates that ionospheric outflow is not merely a plasma source for the magnetosphere but an integral part in the nonlinear ionosphere-magnetosphere-ring current system.},

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

abstract = {A few times per month, the density of the plasma sheet is several times higher than its usual density. Such superdense plasma sheet intervals are observed both in the midtail region and at geosynchronous orbit. Typically at geosynchronous orbit, a superdense plasma sheet occurs on the first day of a geomagnetic storm and lasts about 12-18 hours. The occurrences of superdense plasma sheets are found to be related to a distinct pattern of Kp: Kp rising after it has been low for an extended period. The occurrences are also associated with high-density solar wind. Three sources for the material of the superdense plasma sheet are explored: (1) the outer plasmasphere, which is stripped away and drawn into the dayside neutral line when Kp increases, wherein it joins the lobe and eventually joins the plasma sheet; (2) high-density solar-wind, which may have its entry into the plasma sheet controlled by the solar-wind magnetic field; and (3) ionospheric outflow, which is known to be Kp dependent. The occurrence of a superdense plasma sheet has several consequences: it adds to the intensity of the ring current, it may alter the dynamics of the magnetotail and the nature of substorms, and it may provide an enhanced source population for storm-time energetic particles.

IMAGE will utilize the techniques of ultraviolet imaging, neutral atom imaging, and radio plasma imaging to map out global distributions of the electron and proton aurora; the helium ions of the plasmasphere; the ionospheric ion outflow; the medium-energy ions of the near-Earth plasma sheet, ring current, and polar cusp; the high-energy ions of the ring current and trapped radiation belts; and the total plasma density from the ionosphere out to the magnetopause. The imaging perspective is from an elliptical polar orbit with apogee at latitudes from 40°to 90°in the northern hemisphere. For ultraviolet and neutral atom imaging, the time resolution is set by the two-minute spin period of the IMAGE spacecraft, which will be sufficient to track the development of magnetospheric substorms. An important feature of the IMAGE mission is its completely open data set with no proprietary data or intervals.

abstract = {Geomagnetic storms start with activity on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR) driven. The ICME-driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC) driven or sheath (SH) driven by the geoeffective structure responsible for the peak of the storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near-Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH-driven event behaves more like a CIR-driven event than a MC-driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin ≤ -100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996-2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland-Stern or self-consistent electric field and either event-based Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provide the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self-consistent electric field better reproduces SH- and MC-driven events throughout most of the storm timeline, but the Volland-Stern electric field better reproduces CIR-driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data shows that SH-driven events behave more like MC-driven events than CIR-driven storms.},

The DGCPM includes the influences of convection on the changing flux tube volumes, as well as daytime refilling and nighttime draining of plasma, to calculate the plasma tube contents and equatorial plasma density distribution versus time throughout the magnetosphere. SAIDs are regions of latitudinally narrow westward flow of plasma equatorward of the auroral zone. We present DGCPM results for various presumed SAID locations and durations relative to enhanced substorm convection onset and decay, to parametrically elicit the formation of plasmaspheric density trough structures resulting from SAID effects. It is found that imposing a SAID event in the dusk-evening sector for 30 min leads to the formation of a narrow (less than 1 RE near the equatorial plane) embedded plasma density trough in the dusk bulge region. The modeled plasmasphere density profiles with troughs generally resemble plasmasphere density profiles observed from DE 1 measurements. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Numerous studies of the terrestrial magnetosphere that use global magnetohydrodynamic codes have found that the model's inner boundary can act as a significant source of plasma, even if the radial velocity about the boundary is held at zero. Though inherent in many models, this "de facto outflow" is poorly understood. This work uses the Block Adaptive Tree Solar Wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme MHD model to investigate the behavior of this type of outflow as a function of boundary conditions and solar wind drivers. It is found that even for temporally and spatially constant boundary conditions, the mass is accelerated away from the body in a dynamic manner. Fluxes organize into cusp, polar cap, and auroral zone concentrations. Pressure gradient forces appear predominantly responsible for cusp and polar cap outflow, while the Lorentz force, resulting from field-aligned current systems, is the strongest driver of outflow in other regions. Integrated fluxes probed just outside of the inner boundary vary linearly as a function of cross polar cap potential and solar wind dynamic pressure. The resulting dynamics strongly resemble patterns found in in situ measurements, while net fluences agree within an order of magnitude. Two free parameters, inner boundary mass density and composition, can strongly affect results. Accounting for these unknowns is likely best left to physics-based or empirical specifications of outflow. Despite this, such outflow appears to be an acceptable proxy.

abstract = {Over 40 years of ground and spacecraft plasmaspheric measurements have resulted in many statistical descriptions of plasmaspheric properties. In some cases, these properties have been represented as analytical descriptions that are valid for specific regions or conditions. For the most part, what has not been done is to extend regional empirical descriptions or models to the plasmasphere as a whole. In contrast, many related investigations depend on the use of representative plasmaspheric conditions throughout the inner magnetosphere. Wave propagation, involving the transport of energy through the magnetosphere, is strongly affected by thermal plasma density and its composition. Ring current collisional and wave particle losses also strongly depend on these quantities. Plasmaspheric also plays a secondary role in influencing radio signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) is an attempt to assimilate previous empirical evidence and regional models for plasmaspheric density into a continuous, smooth model of thermal plasma density in the inner magnetosphere. In that spirit, the International Reference Ionosphere is currently used to complete the low altitude description of density and composition in the model. The models and measurements on which the GCPM is currently based and its relationship to IRI will be discussed.},

abstract = {Simulation studies of the Earth's radiation belts and ring current are very useful in understanding the acceleration, transport, and loss of energetic particles. Recently, the Comprehensive Ring Current Model (CRCM) and the Radiation Belt Environment (RBE) model were merged to form a Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (CIMI) model. CIMI solves for many essential quantities in the inner magnetosphere, including ion and electron distributions in the ring current and radiation belts, plasmaspheric density, Region 2 currents, convection potential, and precipitation in the ionosphere. It incorporates whistler mode chorus and hiss wave diffusion of energetic electrons in energy, pitch angle, and cross terms. CIMI thus represents a comprehensive model that considers the effects of the ring current and plasmasphere on the radiation belts. We have performed a CIMI simulation for the storm on 5-9 April 2010 and then compared our results with data from the Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers and Akebono satellites. We identify the dominant energization and loss processes for the ring current and radiation belts. We find that the interactions with the whistler mode chorus waves are the main cause of the flux increase of MeV electrons during the recovery phase of this particular storm. When a self-consistent electric field from the CRCM is used, the enhancement of MeV electrons is higher than when an empirical convection model is applied. We also demonstrate how CIMI can be a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting data from the new Van Allen Probes mission.

The most probable quiescent background count rate is 2.7 per pixel, per 600 s EUV image, equivalent to a brightness of approximately 27 mR. This quiescent background rate is ≈10 times larger than the detector dark rate, indicating that quiescent background levels are dominated by external light sources or penetrating particles. We hypothesize two light sources of quiescent background in the interplanetary or interstellar medium. The first is 30.4 nm light from nonplasmaspheric He+. The second is 58.4 nm light (from neutral He) that gets past the filter/mirror. The IMAGE EUV data also exhibit episodic, factor of 3-to-30 increases above the quiescent background rate, throughout the 6 month data set considered herein.

abstract = {The importance of ionospheric O+ on the development of the storm time ring current is recognized but not well understood. The addition of this outflow in global MHD models has the potential to change the magnetic field configuration, particle densities and temperatures, and the convection electric field. This makes including heavy ion outflow in ring current simulations difficult, as this addition cannot be easily decoupled from a host of other changes. This study attempts to overcome this problem by using three coupled models, PWOM, RIM, and BATS-R-US, to drive a ring current model, RAM-SCB. The differences in drivers when outflow is included and is not included are compared to see how outflow changes ring current input. It is found that including this outflow reduces the convection electric field, lowers the plasma sheet number density and temperature, and increases the complexity of the plasma sheet ion composition both temporally and spatially. These changes cause an overall reduction in ring current energy density. Further simulations that attempt to isolate these effects find that the most important change in terms of ring current development is the drop in convection electric field. Local time dependencies of O+ injections are found to be nontrivial as well. Capturing all of these effects requires a whole system, first-principles approach.

abstract = {The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) provides a high-performance flexible framework for physics-based space weather simulations, as well as for various space physics applications. The SWMF integrates numerical models of the Solar Corona, Eruptive Event Generator, Inner Heliosphere, Solar Energetic Particles, Global Magnetosphere, Inner Magnetosphere, Radiation Belt, Ionosphere Electrodynamics, and Upper Atmosphere into a high-performance coupled model. The components can be represented with alternative physics models, and any physically meaningful subset of the components can be used. The components are coupled to the control module via standardized interfaces, and an efficient parallel coupling toolkit is used for the pairwise coupling of the components. The execution and parallel layout of the components is controlled by the SWMF. Both sequential and concurrent execution models are supported. The SWMF enables simulations that were not possible with the individual physics models. Using reasonably high spatial and temporal resolutions in all of the coupled components, the SWMF runs significantly faster than real time on massively parallel supercomputers. This paper presents the design and implementation of the SWMF and some demonstrative tests. Future papers will describe validation (comparison of model results with measurements) and applications to challenging space weather events. The SWMF is publicly available to the scientific community for doing geophysical research. We also intend to expand the SWMF in collaboration with other model developers.

abstract = {The Dynamic Global Core Plasma Model (DGCPM) is an empirical dynamical model of the plasmasphere which, despite its simple mathematical form, or perhaps because of its simple mathematical form, has enjoyed wide use in the space physics modeling community. In this paper we present some recent observations from the European quasi-Meridional Magnetometer Array (EMMA) and compare these with the DGCPM. The observations suggest more rapid daytime refilling and loss than what is described in the DGCPM. We then modify the DGCPM by changing the values of some of its parameters, leaving the functional form intact. The modified DGCPM agrees much better with the EMMA observations. The modification resulted in an order-of-magnitude faster daytime refilling and nighttime loss. These results are also consistent with previous observations of daytime refilling.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Cluster mission, ESA's first cornerstone project, together with the SOHO mission, dating back to the first proposals in 1982, was finally launched in the summer of 2000. On 16 July and 9 August, respectively, two Russian Soyuz rockets blasted off from the Russian cosmodrome in Baikonour to deliver two Cluster spacecraft, each into their proper orbit. By the end of August 2000, the four Cluster satellites had reached their final tetrahedral constellation. The commissioning of 44 instruments, both individually and as an ensemble of complementary tools, was completed five months later to ensure the optimal use of their combined observational potential. On 1 February 2001, the mission was declared operational. The main goal of the Cluster mission is to study the small-scale plasma structures in three dimensions in key plasma regions, such as the solar wind, bow shock, magnetopause, polar cusps, magnetotail and the auroral zones. With its unique capabilities of three-dimensional spatial resolution, Cluster plays a major role in the International Solar Terrestrial Program (ISTP), where Cluster and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are the European contributions. Cluster's payload consists of state-of-the-art plasma instrumentation to measure electric and magnetic fields from the quasi-static up to high frequencies, and electron and ion distribution functions from energies of nearly 0 eV to a few MeV. The science operations are coordinated by the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC), at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), and implemented by the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. A network of eight national data centres has been set up for raw data processing, for the production of physical parameters, and their distribution to end users all over the world.

While the “free spirit” approach of academia enables the rapid emergence and testing of new ideas and methods, the lack of long-term stability and support makes this arrangement very challenging.

It took a quarter of a century to develop this capability and reach its present level of maturity that makes it suitable for research use by the space physics community through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) as well as operational use by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).},

In this review, I discuss the long-term evolution of the solar wind, including the evolution of observed properties that are intimately linked to the solar wind: rotation, magnetism and activity. Given that we cannot access data from the solar wind 4 billion years ago, this review relies on stellar data, in an effort to better place the Sun and the solar wind in a stellar context. I overview some clever detection methods of winds of solar-like stars, and derive from these an observed evolutionary sequence of solar wind mass-loss rates. I then link these observational properties (including, rotation, magnetism and activity) with stellar wind models. I conclude this review then by discussing implications of the evolution of the solar wind on the evolving Earth and other solar system planets. I argue that studying exoplanetary systems could open up new avenues for progress to be made in our understanding of the evolution of the solar wind.},

abstract = {The Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) mission is the first mission in NASA's MIDEX (Mid-size Explorer) program. It is the first satellite mission that is dedicated to imaging the Earth's magnetosphere. IMAGE will utilize the techniques of ultraviolet imaging, neutral atom imaging, and radio plasma imaging to map out global distributions of the electron and proton aurora; the helium ions of the plasmasphere; the ionospheric ion outflow; the medium-energy ions of the near-Earth plasma sheet, ring current, and polar cusp; the high-energy ions of the ring current and trapped radiation belts; and the total plasma density from the ionosphere out to the magnetopause. The imaging perspective is from an elliptical polar orbit with apogee at latitudes from 40°to 90°in the northern hemisphere. For ultraviolet and neutral atom imaging, the time resolution is set by the two-minute spin period of the IMAGE spacecraft, which will be sufficient to track the development of magnetospheric substorms. An important feature of the IMAGE mission is its completely open data set with no proprietary data or intervals. All data, along with software needed for plotting and analysis, will be available within 24 hours of acquisition.},
